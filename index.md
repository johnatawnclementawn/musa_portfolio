Although train delays may seem like minor annoyances in the daily life of a commuter, there are real economic costs to train tardiness. The city of New York Office of the Controller found that major delays (5 minute delays) annually cost the city $170.2 million dollars (Stringer, 2017). The algorithm that we have developed predicts how late trains will be based on a variety of variables, and can be utilized by agencies, researchers, and the average commuter. While the algorithm was built and tested on the NJ Transit system data, the model could be deployed for transit systems across the US.  

We used data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/pranavbadami/nj-transit-amtrak-nec-performance?select=2018_11.csv">Kaggle</a> to predict lateness of trains via a linear regression which takes into account, weather, time, and other variables to predict lateness of trains.  

Finally, we pitched our classmates on the posibility of a transit application built around our analytics. The presentation can be found here: [presentation link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKvH-xgyHvM)

<b>[Bikeshare Demand Prediction](/Projects/Train_prediction.html)</b> <br>

US cities such as New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia have welcomed the installation of docked bike-sharing systems. For operators of these systems, it is critical to ensure that bikes are balanced across the network of stations. If there are too few bikes at a station, ridership will decrease due to lack of bike supply. If there are too many bikes at a station, riders will be frustrated if they need to ride to a station further from their desired destination with more spaces and eventually stop using the service. This analysis proposes an algorithm for predicting the demand of bikes in the Capital Bikeshare network in Washington D.C.

<b>[House Price Prediction](/Projects/hedonicHomePriceModel.html)</b> <br>

The ability to determine an appropriate price for a house that has not been on the market in a few years is a valuable skill to have when entering the housing market. In this study we examined homes in Boulder County, CO and built a linear model which predicted their sale price based on internal characteristics (number of bedrooms/bathrooms, square footage), proximity to amenities such as grocery stores, and the spatial processes of house prices.

Traditionally, city or county police, sheriff, and/or 311 departments have either used rudimentary methods of predicting where crimes or disturbances will occur. These methods of prediction usually entail hot-spot mapping through kernel density analysis. In this workflow, we use regression to model where crimes will occur, and thus allow for more effective and efficient deployment of city or county resources. We also explore the possible negative externalities of a program such as this.
